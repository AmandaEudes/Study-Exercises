# Create an implementation of the Atbash cipher, an ancient encryption system
# created in the Middle East.

# The Atbash cipher is a simple substitution cipher that relies on transposing
# all the letters in the alphabet such that the resulting alphabet is backwards.
# The first letter is replaced with the last letter, the second with the
# second-last, and so on.

# An Atbash cipher for the Latin alphabet would be as follows:

# Plain:  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
# Cipher: zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba
# It is a very weak cipher because it only has one possible key, and it is a
# simple mono-alphabetic substitution cipher. However, this may not have been an
# issue in the cipher's time.

# Ciphertext is written out in groups of fixed length, the traditional group
# size being 5 letters, leaving numbers unchanged, and punctuation is excluded.
# This is to make it harder to guess things based on word boundaries. All text
# will be encoded as lowercase letters.

# Examples
# - Encoding test gives gvhg
# - Encoding x123 yes gives c123b vh
# - Decoding gvhg gives test
# - Decoding gsvjf rxpyi ldmul cqfnk hlevi gsvoz abwlt gives
# thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog
